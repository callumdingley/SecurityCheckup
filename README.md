# SecurityCheckup

This program takes a user inputted password into the console and returns
a percentage score based on the security level of that password. A higher
percentage means the password is more secure. 

The program can run on any computer with windows and a working console. 

It is not recommended to input your exact passwords, nor is it recommended to 
accept a modified version of the software from an unknown source. The 
password is not encypted. Modifications for your organization's or 
your own level of security is encouraged.  

The percentage of security is not absolute, and password strength is relative.
